    <h1>Danny Bowien's Chicken Broth</h1>

    <img src="../assets/images/jurien-huggins-StMkapA93O4-unsplash.jpg" alt="Homemade chicken broth in a pot" width="400">

    <p>This rich chicken stock comes from Chef Danny Bowien of Mission Chinese Food, known for his innovative takes on traditional dishes. Bowien's version builds deep flavor through careful simmering and aromatic vegetables. I first experienced Mission Chinese's bold flavors at their original New York City location during my inaugural trip to NYC. While I never cooked this specific recipe in kitchens I worked in, mastering fundamental stocks like this was essential to my culinary training.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3- to 3½-pound chicken, liver and kidneys reserved (optional)</li>
        <li>½ cup quinoa</li>
        <li>10 jarred chestnuts, divided</li>
        <li>4 pitted dates (preferably Chinese jujubes)</li>
        <li>Three 2-inch-long pieces dried ginseng</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, divided</li>
        <li>One 4-inch piece kombu</li>
        <li>¼ cup ginseng concentrate</li>
        <li>1-inch piece fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 cups sliced mushroom caps (such as shiitake or cremini)</li>
        <li>2 cups thinly sliced leafy greens (such as kale or Swiss chard)</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons kosher salt plus extra for serving</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper plus extra for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Add ¼ cup of the quinoa to the chicken's cavity along with 2 chestnuts, 1 date, 1 piece of ginseng and 1 garlic clove. Use butcher's twine to tie the chicken's legs together. Place the chicken in a large pot, and cover with enough cold water to completely submerge the chicken. Place the pot over high heat.</li>
        
        <li>Add the kombu, ginseng concentrate, and ginger. Add the remaining chestnuts, dates, ginseng, garlic. Add the innards, if you're using them. Once the water comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Remove the chicken when its internal temperature reads 130° on an instant-read thermometer. (If you're gonna eat the chicken—and really, why wouldn't you?— bake it for 30 additional minutes in a 300° oven. Let it rest 10 minutes before carving.)</li>
        
        <li>Turn off the heat on the stove. Remove the kombu, kidneys, and liver, from the broth and discard.</li>
        
        <li>Add the mushrooms, leafy greens, and remaining quinoa to the broth in the pot. Salt and pepper to taste. Increase the heat to medium-high; once the broth comes to a simmer, reduce the heat to low for 30 minutes. When ready, serve with rice noodles, lime juice, chilis, fish sauce, or whatever else your kid will eat.</li>
    </ol>
