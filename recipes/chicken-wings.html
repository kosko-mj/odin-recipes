    <p>These Vietnamese-style chicken wings come from Chef Andy Ricker's Pok Pok, the Portland restaurant that introduced many Americans to authentic Northern Thai cuisine. Ricker's wings are marinated in fish sauce and garlic, then fried twice for maximum crispiness. When I lived in Portland, Pok Pok was a regular spot for me—these wings paired with their signature tamarind old fashioned made for perfect late-night meals.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup Asian fish sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup superfine sugar</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, 2 crushed and 2 minced</li>
        <li>3 pounds chicken wings, split at the drumettes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped mint</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk the fish sauce, sugar and crushed garlic. Add the wings and toss to coat. Refrigerate for 3 hours, tossing the wings occasionally.</li>
        <li>Heat the 2 tablespoons of oil in a small skillet. Add the minced garlic; cook over moderate heat until golden, 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat 2 inches of oil to 350°. Pat the wings dry on paper towels; reserve the marinade. Put the cornstarch in a shallow bowl, add the wings and turn to coat. Fry the wings in batches until golden and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels and transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, simmer the marinade over moderately high heat until syrupy, 5 minutes. Strain over the wings and toss. Top with the cilantro, mint and fried garlic and serve.</li>
    </ol>
